Klapp is a mobile application built with SwiftUI following the MVVM architectural pattern.
It allows users to explore the latest movies currently in theaters, upcoming releases, and manage a personal list of favorites.

The app integrates with The Movie Database (TMDB) API for movie data and uses Firebase for authentication and favorites management.
